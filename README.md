## Problem Title

SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers

## Problem Description

A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

### Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

### Expected Outcomes

* A **multilingual, voice-first advisory system** accessible via basic phones (IVR/SMS) as well as smartphones.
* A **profit-first crop recommender** that advises based on income potential, not just suitability.
* Weather-based **actionable alerts** (e.g., irrigation delay, pest risk).
* Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
* Farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing network (AI-powered translation of voice tips).
* Market price tracking and profit prediction for each crop option.
* AI-driven pest/disease detection via image uploads (for smartphone users).
* Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

### Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

* Small and marginal farmers
* Agricultural extension officers
* Government agriculture departments
* NGOs and cooperatives
* Agri-tech startups

### Supporting Data

* 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
* ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by **20–30%**.
* Digital India survey shows that **over 65% of rural farmers own only basic phones**, so non-smartphone solutions are crucial.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a **Voice-Based Profit-Optimized Farming Calendar** that combines AI, market intelligence, and farmer community knowledge to deliver *daily, personalized, and profit-driven farming advice* to small and marginal farmers.

### How it addresses the problem

* Removes dependency on smartphones by using **IVR calls and SMS** in local languages.
* Focuses on **profitability**, not just crop growth, by combining soil, weather, and mandi price data.
* Builds **trust** through a farmer-to-farmer voice knowledge-sharing network.
* Reduces crop loss by giving **weather-based timely alerts**.
* Promotes **sustainable farming** by recommending optimal fertilizer and pesticide usage.

### Innovation and Uniqueness

* **Voice-first design** → works for digitally illiterate farmers.
* **Profit-first recommendation engine** → farmers choose crops based on earnings, not guesses.
* **Farmer wisdom amplified by AI translation** → local solutions spread nationwide.
* **Offline-first and IoT-ready** → future integration with soil sensors, drones, etc.

## Technical Approach

* **Input Layer**: Farmer interacts via IVR call, SMS, WhatsApp, or optional IoT sensors.
* **Processing Layer**:

  * AI/NLP for farmer queries in local languages.
  * Crop profitability engine (soil + weather + market prices).
  * Pest/disease detection using image ML models.
* **Output Layer**:

  * Voice advisories via IVR.
  * SMS reminders.
  * Peer-knowledge sharing network.
* **Database Layer**: Stores farmer profiles, soil data, crop history, and feedback.

**Farmer Journey Example:**

1. Farmer calls toll-free number → asks “Which crop should I grow this season?”
2. System checks soil, weather, and market → replies with profit comparison.
3. Farmer selects crop → system sends a **30-step farming calendar** via SMS + weekly calls.
4. Weather changes → farmer gets alert: “Rain expected tomorrow, delay irrigation.”
5. Farmer shares a voice tip → AI translates & distributes to 50 nearby farmers.

## Feasibility and Viability

### Feasibility

* Technically feasible using existing IVR, AI/ML, and open government APIs (IMD weather, mandi prices).
* Scalable nationwide with support from government schemes (Digital Agriculture Mission, PM-Kisan).

### Potential Challenges

* Trust issues → farmers may hesitate to adopt.
* Data gaps (soil data not always available).
* Cost of running large-scale IVR systems.

### Strategies to Overcome

* Start with **pilot programs** in 2–3 villages to build credibility.
* Partner with **Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)** and local cooperatives for farmer onboarding.
* Use **government subsidies or CSR funding** to cover IVR costs.

## Impact and Benefits

### Potential Impact

* Farmers receive **personalized, income-driven advisories** that increase profits by 20–30%.
* Reduction in pesticide/fertilizer misuse → healthier crops and environment.
* Improved food security and rural economic stability.
* Stronger farmer communities through **knowledge sharing**.

### Benefits

* **Social**: Farmers gain confidence and independence.
* **Economic**: Higher profits, reduced input costs.
* **Environmental**: Sustainable farming practices reduce soil and water damage.
